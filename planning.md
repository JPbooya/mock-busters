# Planning

This is for listing our requirements per Sprint as well as noting things to discuss or change when we meet.

## Sprint 2
Incorporate multiple view pages, EJS, and routing into your application. Save data to an in-memory array. Add navigation to your site.
### Requirements
- Two express routes
    - / (home)
    - /billing
- ~~Use EJS views~~ - This was done in Sprint 1
- Display confirmation page on form submission
    - Somewhat complete; confirmation page needs work.
- Save the form data to an in-memory array with timestamps
- Add a route that displays all submissions from the in-memory array 
    - I recommend we use "/admin"
    - Data must be formatted in a "clean, readable layout"
- A navigation bar that links to all pages is visible on every page
    - Specifically mentions all *major* pages.
    - Navigation bar requires "partials", we haven't discussed this in class yet.
